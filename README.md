# Hello world!

i’m a non-binary, neurodivergent software dev from the uk that makes cool websites (and some other stuff too).

i began coding in early 2022 when i built my first discord bot. since then i’ve built many more bots, alongside rest apis, npm packages, chrome extensions, and game mods, but eventually i found my niche in webdev.

i started with javascript, but now i almost always use typescript for the majority of my projects. for webdev, my preferred toolkit includes react, astro, or nextjs, usually paired with tailwindcss as well.
